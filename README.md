Shattered: A Color Changing STG
    Local gamedev reinvents Ikaruga and it might actualy be fun!

Shattered is a color changing shoot-em-up (STG) being developed by me. Players fight "chips"" on various panes of class in order to protect the glass galaxy.
All enemies live on a colored plane and cannot be interacted with on their home plane. Players have limited ammo and are forced to switch panes often to progress.
